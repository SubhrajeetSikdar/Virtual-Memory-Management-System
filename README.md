# Virtual Memory Manager (VMM)

## Introduction

This project implements a simple virtual memory manager (VMM) in Python. The VMM simulates the memory management techniques used by modern operating systems to manage processes and their memory allocations.

## Features

- **Page Replacement Algorithms:** Implements a simple page replacement algorithm to handle page faults.
- **Multi-threaded Simulation:** Uses threading to simulate concurrent execution of processes and memory management tasks.
- **Address Translation:** Translates virtual addresses to physical addresses using a page table.
- **Memory Management:** Manages memory allocation and deallocation for processes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install dependencies (if any):
4. 
### Usage

1. Run the main script:


- `<input_file>`: Path to the file containing process requests.
- `<memory_size>`: Total memory size in bytes.

2. View the output in the console.
